# hid-toggle
This program is designed to sidestep issues with certain games where the games themselves are not programmed to handle multiple input devices (even if some are unused). You can use this to disable unused devices via software to avoid conflicts and having to unplug/replug devices and some of the control-assignment headaches that can result from that.
