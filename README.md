# hid-toggle
This program sidesteps issues with certain games where the games themselves are not programmed to handle multiple input devices, even if some devices are unused. Generally, this occurs in games designed around a console-style controller that don't know what to do when they also find other devices plugged in like joysticks, rudder pedals, etc. This program is designed to disable unused devices via software to avoid conflicts and having to unplug/replug devices, which can really mess up painstakingly set up controller bindings in some games. Note: The program/script will need to be run with administrator privledges, since it's method of toggling devices basically amounts to enabling them/disabling them under device manager.

WORK IN PROGRESS: Currently have a working .bat script to pull device summaries t obtain device ID's. Once non-xbox controller style devices are identified, they can be manually input into deactivate/reactivate scripts to turn them on/off seperately. I am currently working to put together a Python script to automate this process, so that you only need to run one application to scan current devices and turn stuff on/off as needed.
